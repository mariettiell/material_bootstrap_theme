<h1 id="material-design-for-bootstrap-3">Material design for Bootstrap 3</h1>
<p>This theme is a skin for Bootstrap, which means that can be used with any site built with the Bootstrap framework 3. With easy installation and customization thanks to the LESS/SASS files included and the custom themes colors ready to use. 
This skin is based on a material design and also extends the styles directly applied to Bootstrap files. There’s no overwritten rules or bloating CSS, making a lightweight skin as Boostrap is itself. </p>
